# Disjoint-Set-data-structure

Problem:
A Disjoint-Set data structure should be implemented, with the most efficient algorithm (union by rank and path compression), as an abstract data type
.
Design and implement (write a program) an algorithm to find the connected components in a binary image using Disjoint-Set data structure
